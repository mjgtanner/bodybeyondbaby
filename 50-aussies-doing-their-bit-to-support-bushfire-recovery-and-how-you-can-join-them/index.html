				</section><section class="article__main"><p>I’ve spent lots of the last few weeks on beaches in Perth – blue skies, clear water – while the rest of our country has been burning. I feel guilty (for being here and enjoying this when others are losing homes, lives and livelihoods); I feel sad. My heart hurts at the scale of this disaster and the fact that the longer it goes on, the more damage is done, and yet the more desensitised we potentially become.</p>
<p>And I feel waves of anger from time to time; not angry about what is happening per-se but angry at some of the responses. The armchair critics playing the blame game when homes are burning (blame, I think, is the one thing that gets my back up in a BIG way), telling others what they could or should have done better and unwilling to make a change on an individual level.</p>
<p>I’ve grappled with the best way to help or contribute, fully aware that aid is needed in some places yet may be a huge hindrance in others; fully aware that there is no quick-fix for this situation. Emotions are high and people are hurting. This is a situation that goes on long after the fires have gone out and it’s 100% down to us ALL to do our bit to create lasting change.</p>
<p>We have a choice to make: we can sit in overwhelm or blame, move back to our armchairs and decide either our individual effort is not enough to count or that it is someone else’s responsibility. Alternatively, we can allow ourselves to feel the enormity of what is happening here in Australia – grieve, cry, reflect (do whatever we need to do to cope) – and then create considered ACTION.</p>
<ul><li>Consider WHERE your fundraising dollars are going.</li>
<li>Consider HOW you can support victims of the fires long after they have ended.</li>
<li>Consider WHAT long-term change you will make in your everyday life that has the potential to create an impact when we all commit to doing the same.</li>
</ul><p>Our family has come up with some ideas already that we will be implementing in 2020 that I will share on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bodybeyondbaby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Instagram channel</strong></a> and will be tagging those that have been making the important small changes long before me (think buying a keep-cup is small, but it will save 365 coffee cups that would usually end up as land-fill – they are NOT recyclable).</p>
<p>KNOW every little thing you choose to do adds up and when we are ALL in this together we create a ground-swell toward positive change and that’s exactly what we need here in Australia right now.</p>
<p>As a small gesture in this country’s time of need I have created this list of FIFTY everyday Aussies doing their bit to support others.</p>
<p>I have consciously leaned toward services that are offering a fund-raising element to a service they already offer or are running specific fundraising events, as I truly believe we need to be questioning our consumerism attitudes at this time.  They include sustainable product-based businesses that are providing goods that support our environment and also direct links to smaller funds that are not necessarily providing a service but are out on a limb at this time and are in need of direct help.</p>
<p>There are a considerable number of fitness services running awesome events in the coming days and weeks which make sense given fitness is what we do AND it’s a win-win for everyone – you get healthier and help others in the process.</p>
<p>Please do your due diligence on which charities will benefit from your kind offerings so you know where your contribution is going and consider just giving where you can.</p>
<p>Let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>1. Justine Coombes and the Dent Global team</strong> have been supporting the community of Admirably in the Snowy Mountains cooking for and delivering much-needed but SPECIFIC supplies to those currently fighting fires. The small town is having to evacuate for a second time with more fires coming their way.</p>
<p>Up until now, they have been gathering funds via a direct bank account however they now have a fundraising page where you can donate. <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/donate/461205524811439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find it here.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Clifton Creek Primary School</strong> was burned to the ground on 31 December 2019. The community is located a short distance inland from Lakes Entrance in Victoria. In conjunction with the business manager of the school and the Terry Floyd Foundation (that is gathering donations for the rebuild of the school), Kasey Banes is co-ordinating a project to help repopulate their school library. <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/rural-primary-school-reduced-to-ash-in-gippsland-bushfire-crisis/2e6072e7-e2ff-4c6d-be19-7b14edeb2ef7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Go here for more information</strong></a>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Gary and Sara raise and care for kangaroos in Cobargo NSW</strong> which was totally decimated by fire. In amongst that carnage this amazing couple were back on their property within 48 hours to find everything gone. EVERYTHING! There was nothing left. They arrived with a trailer load of food for their kangaroos and slept in their car as they waited for their family to come “home”. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/wildlife-fire-ground-carers?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>To support Gary, Sara and their Kangaroo’s go here.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>4. Wildlife Rescue South Coast</strong> is raising much needed funds to help purchase food. They also need funds for vet bills and medication as they expect animals burnt in the fires to come their way for treatment over the coming weeks and months. They will also be setting up feeding stations immediately. This is where local community members can pick up wildlife food and water supplies to put in their front yards to help those animals who escaped the fires but now have no food or water to survive over the next 3-4 months until growth reappears. <a href="https://wildlife-rescue-south-coast-incorporated.giveeasy.org/we-need-your-urgent-help?fbclid=IwAR1Az9jHcTDraHRhAhpmjQP3FnLW7K-dxBPbsr_7IuUFDLoZPZdspEMfax0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Go here to help.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>5. </strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/businesschicks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Business Chicks Australia’s</strong></a> next international speaker Elizabeth Gilbert has made a huge gesture in donating the entire speaking fee of her tour with us to bushfire relief and we’re standing with her. All profits from this national tour will also be donated, plus they will be doing additional fundraising at each event. <strong><a href="https://businesschicks.com/elizabethgilbert/?fbclid=IwAR24cSj3wIpleW9kJmEgh1OCbG8ryjNOxyt6ZEbBmvY3YWhVDNm_YLFGrPg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get your Elizabeth Gilbert tickets here.</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Yoga Sanctuary in Mornington,</strong> McCrae and Phillip Island’s Smith Beach is doing Beach Yoga and donating 100% of funds to Wildlife Victoria. Details are: Sunday 12 January for Beach Yoga, at Mornington, McCrae and Phillip Island’s Smith Beach, commencing 9:00am. Class suitable for all levels, beginners to advanced, so bring your friends and family. They will also be donating 15% of their profits for the season to bushfire relief. <strong><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/bushfire-relief-beach-yoga-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">To register for yoga go here.</a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7. <a href="https://thefruitcart.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fruit Cart</a></strong> will be donating a minimum of $500 to the RFS but would love to give a bit more so this is what’s happening in January: every time someone picks up a TRIAL box, $10 from the purchase will be donated to the cause and on the 31st of January they will double the amount total. They deliver to Sydney’s Inner West and Sutherland shire. <strong><a href="https://thefruitcart.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go here to place your order</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>8. Two Sides Accounting</strong> are offering free individual income tax returns to volunteer fire fighters. They have capacity for about 30 returns. <strong><a href="https://www.twosides.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get in touch with Nat here</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>9. Gippsland Emergency Relief Fund</strong> are distributing to disaster victims in Gippsland who have been hit hard. The fund provides relief and assistance to persons residing in the Gippsland municipalities of Bass Coast, South Gippsland, Latrobe, Baw Baw, Wellington and East Gippsland who suffer injury, loss, or damage from natural disasters. All donations are tax deductible. <a href="https://www.gerf.org.au/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Go here to help the people of Gippsland and surrounds</strong>.</a></p>
<p><strong>10. Shelby Jansen and her team at <a href="https://www.hypervioletdesigns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperviolet Designs</a></strong> have decided that in order to help the rural firefighters’ efforts and the people on the front line, this month they are offering free gig posters to all contributing bands or artists. Instead of taking the payment themselves, selling a product and donating a percentage, or requesting contribution to the myriad of fundraising platforms which will take a cut or hold funds in the interim, all they request is that you donate $50 directly to the bank account of the NSW or VIC rural fire services. Please screenshot your payment receipt and send an email to <strong><a href="mailto:info@hypervioletdesigns.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">info@hypervioletdesigns.com</a></strong> with your event info and design requests.</p>

<p><strong>51. Last, but most importantly, YOU </strong>– (I know I said 50 but this one is worth it) YOU get to be the everyday Aussie making a difference in everything that you do moving forward.  In every kind word you say. In every hug that you give and sorry that you say. In every purchase that you question before you consume and every choice that you make to use sustainable products and reduce waste. Know that YOU/ WE have the potential to change our whole world when we ALL do the little things.</p>
<p>I’d like to add before closing this post: not one of these people has asked to be listed OR for any kind of call out. Some of them are regular favourite people/businesses of mine and others I’ve never heard of and discovered after talking to Instagram, closed Facebook groups and simply looking around at what a sample of support for what our country is going through looks like.</p>
<p>The need for recognition is low and the key benefit to using a brand or name behind a fundraiser is the networks of loyal humans and the ability to raise awareness more efficiently. The want and desire to give and help at this time is driven from kindness and is to be applauded on every level. I have shed tears whilst researching and have been blown away with the humanity that is currently being displayed.</p>
<p>We may not be able to change what has been but through action and working together we do get to influence the future.</p>
<p>I’d now love to invite you to share this post with your networks on your own pages or by tagging friends in the comments. AND add to it in the comments below more everyday humans that are doing their bit to support our communities at this time.</p>
<p>Big Love</p>
